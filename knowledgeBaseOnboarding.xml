		If the Bank Name is "Not Applicable", then click onto the Search icon which is available near the Electronic Transfer.
		A new window will ask for Bank Name, Branch name, etc.
		  
		In that enter your Bank name % without space. 
		For Example: Bank name is HDFC. enter as %HDFC% then click onto search. You will get a list of bank and branch. Choose your bank details and submit it.
		  
		Do you require any further help?
